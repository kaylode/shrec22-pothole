# Datasets

## Non-labelled dataset

- We utilize non-annotated datasets for unsupervised training branch. These are images of cracks and potholes "in the wild" which will enhance the capabilities of model predicting on out-of-distribution samples.

- Moreover, the provided rgb-d videos from the organizers are cut into separated frames and used as unlabelled samples as well.

## Pixel-wise annotated dataset (Pothole Mix dataset)

- We use annotated data which have been given to all the track's participants for fully-supervised training.

> This dataset for the semantic segmentation of potholes and cracks on the road surface was assembled from 5 other datasets already publicly available, plus a very small addition of segmented images on our part. To speed up the labeling operations, we started working with depth cameras to try to automate, to some extent, this extremely time-consuming phase. We hope to be able to release a new version of the Pothole Mix dataset soon with a more significant contribution from us.
